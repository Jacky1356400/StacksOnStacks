# StacksOnStacks

Stacks on Stacks returns with a new twist. Ingots are individual multipart blocks!

This allows for placing any amount of ingots in any position in the block!

This mod is incompatible with optifine, attempting to place an ingot with optifine installed will crash your game due to it's hacky render changes. This cannot be fixed.
